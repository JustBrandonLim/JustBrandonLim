# JustBrandonLim

I am a software engineer based in Singapore with a deep passion for programming that began at the age of 12 when I received my first computer. Since then, I have dedicated myself to continuously refining my skills and developing innovative solutions that enhance everyday life.

In addition to my professional work, I occasionally pursue personal projects to explore creative ideas and further expand my expertise. Outside of programming, I enjoy staying active at the gym and unwinding at home with my favorite video games.
