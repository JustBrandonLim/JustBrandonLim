# Brandon Lim
I am an avid programmer and a fitness enthusiast. I grew up loving the world of Information Technology and wrote my first line of code at the age of 12. I developed an interest in programming and hacking after playing against some hackers when I was young. I am currently actively participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
